# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Chipotle Restaurant Orders
This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing Chipotle restaurant order information. The dataset includes variables such as item name, order quantity, price per item, and total order value.

Objectives:
Understand Data Structure: Analyze the dataset to identify key variables and their relationships, including order frequency and price distributions.
Data Cleaning: Address missing or inconsistent data entries, such as incomplete orders or incorrect price entries.
Sales Insights: Identify the most popular items, high-revenue products, and trends in customer ordering habits.
Customer Preferences: Explore combinations of menu items frequently ordered together to uncover potential cross-selling opportunities.
Visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present findings, such as bar charts for top-selling items and heatmaps for item pairings.
The analysis will provide actionable insights for menu optimization, pricing strategies, and improving customer satisfaction by understanding ordering behavior at Chipotle.




# Predicting City Population Based on Area
This project focuses on creating a model to predict the population of a city based on its area. The input dataset contains information about cities, specifically their area (in km²) and population.

Steps:
Data Loading and Preparation:

Load the dataset into the analysis environment.
Explore the data structure and check for missing or outlier values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the relationship between city area and population using a scatter plot.
Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, and variance for both variables.
Model Development:

Use a regression model (e.g., linear regression) to identify the relationship between city area and population.
Split the data into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.
Model Evaluation:

Assess model accuracy using metrics like R², RMSE, or MAE.
Analyze discrepancies between actual and predicted values.
Results Interpretation:

Evaluate how well the model describes the dependency between city area and population.
Suggest possible improvements if the predictions are not sufficiently accurate.
