# [EDA n Chipotle Restaurant Orders](https://github.com/slepankovamarta/the-git-rocks/blob/main/EDA%20Intro.ipynb)
This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing Chipotle restaurant order information. The dataset includes variables such as item name, order quantity, price per item, and total order value.

Objectives:
Understand Data Structure: Analyze the dataset to identify key variables and their relationships, including order frequency and price distributions.
Data Cleaning: Address missing or inconsistent data entries, such as incomplete orders or incorrect price entries.
Sales Insights: Identify the most popular items, high-revenue products, and trends in customer ordering habits.
Customer Preferences: Explore combinations of menu items frequently ordered together to uncover potential cross-selling opportunities.
Visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present findings, such as bar charts for top-selling items and heatmaps for item pairings.
The analysis will provide actionable insights for menu optimization, pricing strategies, and improving customer satisfaction by understanding ordering behavior at Chipotle.

# [Predicting City Population Based on Area](https://github.com/slepankovamarta/the-git-rocks/blob/main/Population%20excercise%20GitHub.ipynb)
This project focuses on creating a model to predict the population of a city based on its area. The input dataset contains information about cities, specifically their area (in km²) and population.

Steps:
Data Loading and Preparation:

Load the dataset into the analysis environment.
Explore the data structure and check for missing or outlier values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the relationship between city area and population using a scatter plot.
Calculate basic statistics such as mean, median, and variance for both variables.
Model Development:

Use a regression model (e.g., linear regression) to identify the relationship between city area and population.
Split the data into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.
Model Evaluation:

Assess model accuracy using metrics like R², RMSE, or MAE.
Analyze discrepancies between actual and predicted values.

# [Classifying Car Dealerships with KNN](https://github.com/slepankovamarta/the-git-rocks/blob/main/CarStore.ipynb)

This exercise focuses on using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify two car dealerships based on their sales data. The dataset includes features such as the number of cars sold, customer demographics, and the dealership's location.

#### Objectives:
1. **Understand Classification with KNN**:
   - Learn how the KNN algorithm groups similar data points to classify dealerships.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explore and preprocess the dataset, including feature scaling and handling missing values.

3. **Model Implementation**:
   - Train a KNN model to distinguish between the two dealerships.
   - Use features such as sales numbers, customer age groups, and location for classification.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Assess the model’s accuracy using cross-validation and metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize decision boundaries to understand the separation of classes.

5. **Insights**:
   - Analyze what factors contribute most to the classification of dealerships.
   - Explore how the number of neighbors (k) impacts the model's performance.




Evaluate how well the model describes the dependency between city area and population.
Suggest possible improvements if the predictions are not sufficiently accurate.
