# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Chipotle Restaurant Orders
This project involves conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing Chipotle restaurant order information. The dataset includes variables such as item name, order quantity, price per item, and total order value.

Objectives:
Understand Data Structure: Analyze the dataset to identify key variables and their relationships, including order frequency and price distributions.
Data Cleaning: Address missing or inconsistent data entries, such as incomplete orders or incorrect price entries.
Sales Insights: Identify the most popular items, high-revenue products, and trends in customer ordering habits.
Customer Preferences: Explore combinations of menu items frequently ordered together to uncover potential cross-selling opportunities.
Visualization: Use data visualization techniques to present findings, such as bar charts for top-selling items and heatmaps for item pairings.
The analysis will provide actionable insights for menu optimization, pricing strategies, and improving customer satisfaction by understanding ordering behavior at Chipotle.
